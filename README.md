Game History:

Ateroids originally designed by Lyle Rains and Dominic Walsh, released by Atari. Inc. in 1971.
Simply, Asteroids is an 'arcade space shooter' game. A spaceship object is controlled by the player with the ability to shoot bullets, and move around an asteroid filled space.
Occasionally random flying saucers will appear throughout the virtual space which can shoot back.
The key object of the game is to shoot the moving asteroids, and saucers.  Caution is needed not to collide with either, or death occurs.
